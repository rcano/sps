Scala parboiled2 syntax is a project which simply defines all of the syntax of scala in parboiled2 rules.
Note that the project doesn't aim to provide an AST at all.

The idea of the project is to have a set of rules that correctly represent the current state of scala's syntax without defining any AST,
so in order you use it, you would fork it and add your own ast to the already defined rules.

Current State
-------------

I just finished defining all the rules from the spec but in an almost automatic way, but they wont work since the rules in the spec don't mind LL parsers at all.
Right now imports, literals, and simple declaration (with blocks) works (at least what was tested, see tests).
What was not tested:
 * lambdas
 * function (declaration and usage)
 * Template defintions (classes, traits, objects)
 * Everything else I haven't specificly noted before.
